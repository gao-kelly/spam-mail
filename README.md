# spam_mail
Simple ML spam detector with multinomial NB classifier for tinkering with sets 

Not complete detection model

Text preprocessing cleaned and finalized

Python dependencies:
- Natural language toolkit, Pandas, Scikit-learn (for cleaning email content, modeling, and evaluation)

This model may be developed in future projects and possibly implemented into an extension so I can filter out my outlook
